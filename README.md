GatePlay
========

GatePlay is an in-browser workbench for the creation and simulation of logic circuits. It is supposed to be simple for beginners to use, but not over-simplify the simulation of logic circuits. Enjoy!


Requirements
------------

GatePlay should work in all modern desktop browsers. Unfortuately it does not supported touch-based input properly right now

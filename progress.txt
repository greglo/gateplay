    Remove dependency on Kinetic.js because of:
        Poor perf
        Doesn't easily support snap to grid
    Use Fabric.js
        Because I found the following JSFiddle which has exactly what I want, and its simple:

    Implement snap to grid

15th Nov:
    Disable rotations
    Enable selections
    Stop objects being pulled off canvas
    Refactor


23rd Nov:
    Experiment with collision detection (unsuccessfully)
    Implement CircuitView.js

24th Nov:
    Size canvas to a integral number of blocks

25th Nov:
    Moving objects and selections now updates the model

26th Nov:
    Implement (buggy) collision detection
